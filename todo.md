# To do

- [ ] It is based on tiles, like an old 2D Legend of Zelda game.
- [ ] People are walking in a predictable pattern, turning right when they bump into something.
- [ ] I'm programming, that a player interacts with the mobile phone by tapping any tile to place the virus.
- [ ] When a person bumps into a virus tile, they pickup the virus and continue straight if they can.
- [ ] After a second or two, the virus replicates in the person.
- [ ] When a sick person bumps into another person, a copy of the virus transmits.
- [ ] If a person gets four copies of the virus, the person immediately leaves.
- [ ] The player earns a score by how many seconds it took them to get everyone in the restaurant sick.
- [ ] Cindy is illustrating a cute restaurant with people walking around.
- [ ] The whole restaurant fits on the screen of a mobile phone.
- [ ] To make it plausible why everyone is walking, and why there are arbitrarily placed obstacles, we were thinking some obstacles look a buffet, counter, or bar.
